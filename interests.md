Currently, I am interested with getting into a research group that handles studying different drugs and testing their effects. Nonetheless, there are two possible paths I wish to take once I receive by bachelor's degree. One thing that I am interested in would be attending a pharmacy school for its pharmacy degree program and residency program. For this path, I specifically want to become a pharmacist for a local drug store or a company job that handles drugs. If this path does not sound pleasing by the time I graduate Cal Poly, I want to then go straight into the work force or be part of an internship related to drug development and testing.
